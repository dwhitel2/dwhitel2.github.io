                <h2>1. WAS RESURRECTED FROM THE DEAD</h2>
                <p>Without the resurrection there is no faith, Christianity, or any hope for
                    the future. He rose from the dead,appeared to eyewitnesses, and is still
                    at work today through the Holy Spirit. His resurrection isn’t just about
                    our future, but the importance of our present life.“On earth as it is in
                    Heaven” isn’t simply a habitual prayer, but becomes a legitimate reality.</p>

                <h2>2. SAVED US BY GRACE</h2>
                <p>We are not saved by our good deeds, nor do we have the ability to earn our way into Heaven. We are
                    saved by the gracious act of Jesus being sent to die on a cross, resurrecting from the dead, and
                    establishing His power and victory over sin.</p>

                <h2>3. IS GOD</h2>
                <p>He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, worked miracles and gave us an example to follow. He
                    is fully God and fully man and now sits at the right hand of the Father to intercede for us.</p>

                <h2>4. TOLD US TO LOVE</h2>
                <p>Love isn’t simply an emotion, it’s an action first. All of us want to belong, feel accepted, and
                    significant. If we truly understand the love and grace of Jesus, we will love ALL people and show
                    them that there is no greater acceptance, sense of belonging, and significance than through the love
                    of Jesus.</p>

                <h2>5. TOLD US TO GO</h2>
                <p>Faith in Jesus isn’t just a personal, private emotion or feeling. It is a transforming life change
                    that should force us to share that faith with others. If the message of Jesus is true then our lives
                    should outwardly show it to everyone who crosses our path throughout Richmond and beyond. We aren’t
                    here to idly sit by and complain about what is wrong with our city or this world, then hope that
                    someone else will fix it. We are told to GO! Jesus can and will do great things through YOU and our
                    community!</p>
